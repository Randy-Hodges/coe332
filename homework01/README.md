# Python Test Scripts
This folder contains all of the files related to HW1. These are very basic python functions.

even_or_odd.py determines if each item in a given list is even or odd and prints that to the terminal.
three_list_generator generates three lists: list1 with values 1-10, and 2 others which are the squares and cubes of list1. The values are printed.
